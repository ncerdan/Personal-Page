					<h1>A little bit about me<span class="blue">...</span></h1>
					<p></p>
					<h5 class="noMargin">I'm a second year CSE major at UCLA, originating from the Bay Area.</h5>
					<h2 class="noMargin"><span class="blue">--</span></h2>
					<h5 class="noMargin">I have been very interested in computers and their design since I was a little kid, and that passion has only grown now that I have become more and more involved in the world of computing. I love the position I get to be in at this age because there are so many different avenues of knowledge that I'm both interested in, and capable of persuing. </h5>
					<h2 class="noMargin"><span class="blue">--</span></h2>
					<h5 class="noMargin">I have found that many of my colleagues are already trying to focus on one specific aspect of computer science, but, as of right now, I cannot say which application of computing I would like to focus on because I think there are too many different faccets left unexplored. Instead, I'm trying to expose myself to as much information as possible so I can continue to develop my personal skills, and my overall knowledge. </h5>
					<h2 class="noMargin"><span class="blue">--</span></h2>
					<h5>When I'm away from computers, I still like to stay busy. I enjoy staying physcially active through rock climbing, working out, and playing sports. I love exploring the outdoors through activities like SCUBA diving, hiking, and camping. I also enjoy expressing myself through playing acoustic guitar.</h5>
