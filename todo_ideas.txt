TO-DO
-Fill divs!
-fix bug where first icon click fadesIn, out, in
-change from absolute positioning of divs so it fits screens better
	-add to bootstrap to work with different widths etc. 
	-make whole site under title a container to keep spacing?

IDEAS
-blur background image not under info-pane divs when icons selected so focus is on info (filter blur)?
-animation on home page?
-shrink icon next to resume?
-modify link images to bolden on hover?
	-requires divs with background images (very tedious bc requires restructure)
